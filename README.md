Qifan Jiang, qj2172
Though we built and reviewed whole process of this project together, Qifan particularly contributed to the Localization, Enhancement, FeatureExtraction and Evaluation process. When I struggled with detecting outer boundary for a iris, Qifan took the initiative in working on and resolved the problem.
